# 🎲 Number Guessing Game in Python

A beginner-friendly Python game where the computer randomly picks a number, and you have to guess it!  
This project demonstrates the use of **loops, conditionals, and random numbers** in Python.

## 📝 How the Game Works
1. The program selects a **random number** between 1 and 100.  
2. You enter guesses.  
3. The program tells you if your guess is **too high** or **too low**.  
4. Keep guessing until you find the correct number.  
5. It will also show how many attempts you took.

## 💻 Run Locally
If you want to play it on your own computer:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Sivaabhinav/number-guessing-game.git

# Go into the folder
cd number-guessing-game

# Run the Python file
python guessing_game.py
📚 Concepts Used

random.randint() → generate random numbers

while loops → repeat until correct guess

if/elif/else → decision-making

Counters → track attempts
